# What is osu!api v2 Apps Script Wrapper?

The Apps Script Wrapper for osu!api v2 is an unofficial Google Apps Script Library Wrapper maintained by DannyPX. It has complete coverage of osu!api v2 with type safety in mind.

## Why this API wrapper?

- Easy to use without extra code.
- Can create custom functions for non-documented endpoints.
- Has extra endpoints for easier access.
- Fully documented on its own website.

## Coverage

- For the current API, all documented endpoints with a <Badge type="info" text="GET"/> request have been implemented. 
- Some parameters aren't implemented yet, these parameters will be marked with <Badge type="danger" text="not implemented" />.
- Some endpoints with <Badge type="tip" text="POST"/> have been implemented, but aren't tested.
- Some undocumented have been implemented, this will be marked with <Badge type="warning" text="undocumented" />.
- Some endpoints with <Badge type="warning" text="LAZER" /> are meant only for osu!lazer features. Like lazer lobbies.
