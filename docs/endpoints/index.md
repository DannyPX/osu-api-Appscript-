# What is osu!api v2 Appscript Wrapper?

The Appscript Wrapper for osu!api v2 is an unofficial Google Appscript Library Wrapper maintained by DannyPX. It has complete coverage of osu!api v2 with type safety in mind.

## Why this API wrapper?

- Easy to use without extra code.
- Can create custom functions for non-documented endpoints.
- Has extra endpoints for easier access.
- Fully documented on its own website.

## Coverage

osu!api Appscript has a near 100% coverage over the API.

For the current API, all documented endpoints with a <Badge type="info" text="GET"/> request have been implemented. 
Some parameters aren't implemented yet, these parameters will be marked with <Badge type="danger" text="not implemented" />.
Some endpoints with <Badge type="tip" text="POST"/> have been implemented, but aren't tested.
Some undocumented have been implemented, this will be marked with <Badge type="warning" text="undocumented" />.
